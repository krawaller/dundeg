Resting:

* Morale check, recover half of morale if fail


After battle, roll for loot - below monster value

PArty leader is highest morale



Fighting:

when assigning monsters, players choose if ties

check defence first. against ALL who are attacking u

hitting someone not targetting u means no defence dice


pick combat action OR attack!


compare defence score to AGILITY

If pass: receive wounds equal to Monster attack - highest def dice - armour
if fail: receive wounds equal to monster attack - armour (and once by power dice if in guard stance)

passing defence with doubles, means u can escape


attack and defence is simultaneous

hipoints is double con!

fight - order of perception!

attack: power dice applied as damage if in assault (and highest)

can only choose target if no one in my face

when flees, danger goes up
when win, danger goes down
